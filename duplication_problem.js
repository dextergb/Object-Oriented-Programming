/*
* Now there is a general Person class that contains the shared code.
* Student and Mentor inherit behaviour and state information from Person using the keyword extends.
* They also have their own code that reflects behaviour and information only pertaining to themselves.

* Student and Mentor are subclasses of the Person class, since they are extensions of that class.
* Person is the superclass in this relationship.
